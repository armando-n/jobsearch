# jobsearch

This project was a way for me to teach myself C#.  I have never created a windows application before this.

This is a Universal Windows Application that helps me keep track of my job search.  It tracks companies, job titles, descriptions, requirements, responsibilities, links, interviews, communications, notes, and so on for the jobs I have applied for.  It allows them to be easily searched and flagged.

This project is far from complete, but it is currently useful for my needs.  I will continue to put more work on it over time.
